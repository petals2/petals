# petals

Petals is a JavaScript library for everything Scratch, featuring:

### Stem
A pure-JavaScript implementation of the Scratch block editor, allowing you to programmatically load, modify and save Scratch projects.

### Thorn
A custom-made language inspired by TypeScript to compile straight to optimized Scratch blocks, supporting objects, structs, classes and recursive functions - all while being type safe during compile time.

### Bud
A sophisticated optimizer for the Stem package to improve performance, and reduce file sizes dramatically.
